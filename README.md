# MqttClientAspNetCore
Struggled to find documentation on how to set up a basic MQTT client for an ASP.NET Core 6 application.

This is a basic working implementation to demonstrate how it can be achieved.

Client listens on multiple device topics and responds to each one dynamically, such that the devices can be added easily via the config file.
